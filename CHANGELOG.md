## [Unreleased]

## 2.0.0 - 2021-06-23

### Changed

- Rewrite of the integration in the new SDK. This forced some small changes to
  entity properties because underscores are no longer supported. The affected
  properties were `login_id` in personal app entities, `connector_id` in
  application entities, and the prefix `custom_attribute` for custom user
  properties. These were changed to `loginId`, `connectorId` and
  `customAttribute` respectively.

## 1.1.0 - 2021-05-12

### Added

- Added `onelogin_user.custom_attributes.*` to ingest any/all defined custom
  attributes for onelogin users.

## 1.0.11 - 2021-04-28

### Fixed

- Fixed client pagination on `/groups`, `/roles`, and `/apps` endpoints.

## 1.0.10 - 2021-04-26

### Added

- Added logger.info statements throughout the project.
